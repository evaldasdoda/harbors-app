# Harba front-end homework Assignment

At Harba, we have a list of harbours, we display on map, so sailors can book a berth on them.
Here is API endpoint, with a list of harbours [https://devapi.harba.co/harbors/visible](https://devapi.harba.co/harbors/visible)

Your task is to display those harbours on a map (You can choose any 3rd party map; google maps, leaflet or similar)

When you click on particular harbour placeholder, it needs to show extra info:
* Harbour name
* Harbour image thumbnail 
* Current weather in that harbour
* Weather provider
* "Book" button

To get weather information, use weather providers:
* https://openweathermap.org/api
* https://developer.yahoo.com/weather

Eventually you will hit weather provider request limits, so switch provider if it happens, also display current weather provider in the information popup.

"Book" button should display booking form (required fields date from, date to, boat name. You can add optional extra fields if you feel the need). After form submit there should be shown a massage that booking was successful.

For frontend, you can choose from Angular, React or Vue.js
Write unit tests for extra points.

There should be a git repository with README.md, with instructions on how to run project and how to run unit tests. 

Adding docker for running project adds extra points.
